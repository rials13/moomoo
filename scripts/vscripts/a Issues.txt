ISSUES:

All items:
    issue: modifiers for all levels of items the same name so likely wont stack
    issue: update tooltips to new dota style where alt shows more info on all stats (how?)

ballista: 
    issue:  only affects base damage not total damage
    goal:   affects all damage
    problem: infinite damage loops when getting all damage

    issue: multiple ballista aura stacking (for owners will they get the aura from the other)
    goal:   cannot be affected by ballista if owned 
    alernative: allow ballista to stack (aka if you are ranged and have ballista the aura will stack if an allied melee hero has ballista as well) on the basis that it's base damage only

    issue: warclub and ballista do not stack
    problem: they both call the same modifier so they over-write one another 
    solution: have different modifers for each

Glory Axe:
    issue: picking up gold breaks invisibility

All Bashes:
    issue: how to stack or not stack

Halberd:
    issue: cannot have an item in recipe and have it not get consumed 
    goal: use halberd in sadistic axe but still get it back 

    have halberd have 1 charge to "inspect" popping out components used in sadistic axes recipe and keeping halberd

Mithril rod and Trinity
    issue: cannot change main projectile without overwriting when mith rod upgrades 
    solved by: MODIFIER_PROPERTY_PROJECTILE_NAME function
    issue: want to show stacks on trinity for damage done from all stats 

    issue: cannot toggle multishot on and off
    solution: make two sets of tiems one with and without multishot, use dummy items like radiance does.

Sadistic axe:
    gold bag invis issue
    stacks like trinity showing stat damage

Wirts:
    stacking with other forms of boots
    solved by: use MODIFIER_PROPERTY_MOVESPEED_BONUS_UNIQUE

    issue: if it won't stack with boots, have boots be in recipe
    solution: make wirts a recipe / upgrade of boots

Simplicity Axe 1-5
    issue: Bash does not stack
    solution: have different modifiers for each level / check Inventory
    Note: Ragnarok cleave stack with simplicity axe (due to calling a different modifier)

Mask of Tho'roth
    issue: basic dispel tooltip not correct with rest of dota
    solution: need to see how dota defines font-weight
    issue: check particle effects

warlock skull
    issue: add a ranged particle attack

Krakens coat:
    issue: return damage becomes armor outside of base --- what is considered base on this map

Vassal:
    - Get better particles for spells. Rework Conjuration particles 
    - how to auto cast unlock potential
